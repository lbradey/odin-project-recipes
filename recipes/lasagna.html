    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>One Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
        <li>One Small Onion (finely diced)</li>
        <li>Five Cloves of Garlic (finely minced)</li>
        <li>500 grams of Beef Mince</li>
        <li>One Teaspoon of Salt</li>

        <li>Jar of Marinara Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes.
             Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high. 
            Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. </li>
        <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer. </li>
    </ol>
